    "about": "I am focused on front-end development using React and I am open to learning other tools. Additionally, I am studying back-end development to become a full stack developer. Initially, I started my studies in Psychology for two years, but my interest programming led me to dedicate myself exclusively to it. I learned programming by watching videos on YouTube and using other platforms, which allowed me to acquire enough knowledge to create a database, connect it to the backend and make requests from the Mi front-end. The goal is to delve deeper into back-end development to better understand data management and the underlying concepts."
